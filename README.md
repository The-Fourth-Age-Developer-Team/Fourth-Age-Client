This is The Fourth Age Client by Eldarion.
If you want to compile it the following libraries are required:
- GLFW
- GLEW
- stb_image.h available on github.com/nothings/stb, paste it into libs/external folder
To compile it type in:
make
to install it:
make install
which probably requires sudo rights.
